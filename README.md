# digital-circuit
A few python classes that simulate different logic gates and connect them with wires.
These classes is intended to simulate a circuit from the basic logic gates. Go check the main.py file and the usage are already in it.
I haven't really learned about digital circuit so this is only my simple understanding of how a logic circuit works. Please let me know where can I read more about building a circuit!

# Todos
1. Add a new class, 'editor', to manage wires and another class to manage all gates and input/output bars.
2. Find a way to save the created circuit into a file and load a created circuit from a file.
3. Something that may **never** happen: get a gui for the program so that we can see the created circuit and modify it using mouse & keyboard
